# Movidius Neural Compute Stick

Movidius was merged and acquired by Intel at 2016. Movidius purposed an architecture called VPU, that can provide running in the low power but with high calculation capability of computer-vision-based AI inference.

[**Deprecated**] **We encourage you to use OpenVINO toolkit for Movidius devices, not to use the original NCS SDK**.
